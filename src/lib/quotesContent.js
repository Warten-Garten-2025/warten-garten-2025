<p>Biocolonialism: “Since the inception of European exploration, conquest and colonization, animals, plants (and humans) were transported from their areas of origin to Europe for imperial interest, knowledge and profit. Botanical resources in particular were shipped to Europe (and redistributed to other colonies) as commercial crops or as raw materials, particularly after the Industrial Revolution.”</p>

<p>“Imperial taxonomy originated in the destruction and denial of previous systems of classification that it replaced with the incessant impulse to reclassify everything. Everything and everyone must have its precise place in endless lists, indexes, compendiums, and repertoires. Such a place in the archive is meant to supersede people's place in a world previously shared with others.”</p>

<p>“If it is obvious that colonial archives are products of state machines, it is less obvious that they are, in their own right, technologies that bolstered the production of those states themselves."</p>

<p>“If we examine the process of "understanding" people and ideas from the perspective of Western thought, we discover that its basis is this requirement for transparency. In order to understand and thus accept you, have to measure your solidity with the ideal scale providing me with grounds to make comparisons and, perhaps, judgments. I have to reduce.”</p>

<p>“When there is nothing to hear, so much starts to sound. Silence is not the absence of sound but the beginning of listening. This is listening as a generative process not of noises external to me, but from inside, from the body, where my subjectivity is at the centre of the sound production, audible to myself.”</p>

<p>“Silence confirms the soundscape as a sonic life-world, and clarifies the notion that sound is a relationship not between things but just a relationship, passing through my ears.”</p>

<p>“Historical narratives are premised on previous understandings, which are themselves premised on the distribution of archival power.”</p>

<p>“Noise can serve to startle, threaten and annoy; and is often associated with feelings of stress and frustration; however, it may also contribute to feelings of belonging, community and nostalgia.”</p>

<p>“Indigenous and postcolonial scholarship teaches us that friction-free wilderness, devoid of human intervention, never existed in the first place, nor the division of nature and culture.* Likewise, the position of a neutral recordist, or recording, is no longer a tenable position for contemporary practice and has never been.”</p>
